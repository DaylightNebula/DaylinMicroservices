===== Version 0.2 =====
- [x] File System Service
  - Purpose:
    - Some services may need persistently stored files that ARE NOT configs.
    - This is would be a method of storing them that has redundancy and can be quickly referenced.
    - This service would keep a log of ALL changes made to the files to keep track of changes that is kept in blocks so the whole log does not have to be kept in long term storage.
    - This log should contain hashes of ALL files (but not directories)
  - Tags: "file_system"
  - Endpoints: ("-" means the backbone is ready but no endpoint is created yet)
    - [x] list <path>
      - Lists all files at the given path with the given sorting
    - [x] get <path>
      - Returns a file of the given path (the directory or the file)
      - If the file does not exist, return a error
    - [x] push <path> <file>
      - Puts the given file at the given path
      - Logs the change
      - Populates to other file systems (if json is not marked broadcasted)
    - [x] delete <path>
      - Deletes the given path
      - Logs the change
      - Populates to other files systems (if json is not marked broadcasted)
      - If the file does not exist, return an error
    - [x] change_log <since unix time stamp>
      - Returns the log since the given time
      - If a path is given, only return changes in that path
    - [x] hash <path>
      - Returns the hash at the path
      - If directory, returns a list of files and their hashes in the path
- [ ] Other changes
  - [x] Change ids to use UUIDs
  - [ ] Make sure services will work in docker containers with Consul
  - [x] Allow to reference other services by tag in request (optionally self, default false)
  - [x] Broadcast to all services with a given name or tag (optionally self, default false)
    - Mark json objects has broadcasted
