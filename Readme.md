# Daylin Microservices
This is a simple backbone for kotlin based microservices.  
This uses consul for discovery, so you will need that to be setup to use this.  
You can use the run-consul-docker shell or batch files to quickly create and set up a docker with consul for testing.

## Creating a Microservice
Microservices can quickly be created using just a microservice config (described below).
